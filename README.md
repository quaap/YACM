Yet Another Content Manager

This is a content manager I wrote a long time ago. It runs in a J2EE container like Tomcat, Glassfish, or Websphere.  It is loosely based on XWiki.  It used Creole and Freemarker for markup.

I have not updaterd it is many years, and I'm not sure it still works, but I'm putting it here in case someone finds it, or parts of it, useful.
